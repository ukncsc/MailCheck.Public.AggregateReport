[Set up DKIM](https://support.google.com/a/answer/180504)

For configuration using Google as a relay please consult latest guidance online.
### What other Google traffic can appear in your reports?

Google traffic can often appear in your traffic, caused by either:

* the use of Google Groups
* the effects of your emails being auto-forwarded (eg to Gmail accounts).

### How Google Groups fixes DMARC for you
When Groups forwards email it checks your DMARC record. If your policy is:

* `p=none` - it spoofs your original domain, which may then fail SPF and DKIM checks
* `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` - it does not spoof your domain

When you are ready to move to a DMARC policy of quarantine, you can change your DMARC policy to `p=quarantine` and `pct=0`. This policy is the same as p=none but stops Groups spoofing your domain.
### Auto-forwarded Google traffic
The best advice we have for all types of forwarded emails is to try to apply DKIM to as many of your systems as possible. For example, if a DKIM signed email from Office 365 is forwarded through Google it is likely to retain DKIM. SPF on the other hand will almost certainly not pass once emails have been forwarded."

      "mapping": "Mail Check has grouped traffic from IP addresses that appear on public Domain Name System-based Block Lists (DNSBL). When a source IP address on the internet is observed sending spam or malware, mail server operators report to these lists.

This grouping in Mail Check helps because it removes the noise from your analysis – so you can better see email systems that need configuring. It also highlights issues of domain spoofing, which can help you get support from your organisation for strengthening DMARC controls.

NCSC have no control over these data sources. Like any automatically generated list there are likely to be false positives and false negatives. Not all spoofed email will appear in this category in Mail Check; only those that have been identified in these lists. You may also find your legitimate mail ends up being reported as spam - your service provider should be able to advise you on getting off these lists and how to avoid them in future.

We currently check the following lists:
* [sorbs.net](http://www.sorbs.net/)
* [spamhaus.org](https://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/)
* [backscatterer.org](http://www.backscatterer.org/)
